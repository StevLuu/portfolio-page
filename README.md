I started my approach with a sticky Nav, however I found it very unappealing on mobile
So, I opted for a hamburger style popout nav for all the pages and external links
    -this allowed me to get in a JS interaction as well as cleaning up the header
    -The popout nav uses material icons from Google

I had trouble deciding on a theme, so I used a background of a photo I took in Seoul, Korea to add more interest than a monochromatic background could bring.


"About Me" includes my hobbies and interests

"Projects" for now only includes a landscaper game using
     prompts and alerts
     -launched by clicking the button that runs a JS function
        to play the game
     -could not find a good way to open the seperate JS file,
        so I copied it directly to the app.js file

"Resume" hoping to get more involved and deepen it in 
    the near future

In specific places mobile and desktop respond with different styling to compose more intuitively on mobile.

Issues: 
I think the main one is how empty my website feels.
I hope as my skills grow so will this site!

There are some responsiveness issues when the site is on a big display, but regular displays and mobile look good.

I wanted to add a carousel for my photos, but I was having issues with it and scraped it (I will prob come back to that and correct it)
